<h1>Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat!</h1>
<img src="qwe.jpg">
  <p>There are about 115 northern hairy-nosed wombats left in the wild. They all live in Epping Forest National Park in Queensland, Australia. This wombat’s nose is very important in its survival since the creature has very poor eyesight and needs its nose to smell food in the dark.</p>

<h3>Red-Crested Tree Rat!</h3>
<img src="zxc.jpg">
  <p>The red-crested tree rat lives in the forests of Colombia. It was thought to be extinct for many years — until volunteers at the El Dorado Nature Reserve were visited by the creature in 2011. The last recorded sighting was in 1898, when two of the critters were found and studied, and were the subsequent source of all information about the rat. This little critter is about 18 inches long, which is about the same size as a guinea pig. It inhabits a relatively small area of the forest in Colombia, and much of this area has been cleared or disturbed.</p>
